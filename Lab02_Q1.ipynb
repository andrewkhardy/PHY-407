    "Clearly, the second method produces a much greater error (a factor on the order of $10^4$ larger) than the first in the case that the mean of the random Gaussian sampling is set to be large. This notion would hold for 'real' data of a continuous random variable whose value was supposed to be constant. The reason we observe this stark difference in relative error for the two methods in this case when we didn't for the other cases with comparatively small means is because numerical errors are accumulating due to truncation of values when Python stores them between each subsequent step in the for-loop during the computation of $\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i^2 \\text{ and } n\\bar{x}^2$. \n",
    "## Question 1c\n",
    "I postulate that shifting the 'dataset' down by a value comparable to the size of its mean would solve this large numerical error in method 2. We cannot simply subract the mean itself because this would require an additional loop and would defeat the purpose of this single-pass method. The value could be chosen to be the mid-point between the largest and smallest value in the dataset. In general this will be on the same order as the mean is, and is better than just shifting down by the largest value because this may be very large in comparison to the smallest value (depending on the size of the standard deviation in fact) which would result in numerical errors due to smallness of the values and the precision of floating point storage in memory. In otherwords, subtract the mid-point (sometimes reffered to as mode) of the dataset from each element of the data array, thus centering the Gaussian closer to zero. This in no way affects the standard deviation of the set, which is evident by considering that the standard deviation of a dataset sampled from a Gaussian distribution is effectively the 'width' of the Gaussian curve about it's mean. Shifting the mean of course preserves this width. "
