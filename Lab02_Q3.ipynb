    "## Question 3: Stefan-Botzmann constant\n",
    "Note: nothing to hand in for part 5.12a according to the assignment sheet. \n",
    "### Part a\n",
    "Note: this is 5.12b from Newman. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Planck theory of thermal radiation dictates that the amount of thermal energy per second electromagnetically radiated from a black body with unit area in an anglular frequency interval $\\mathrm{d}\\omega$ is the quantity $I(\\omega)\\mathrm{d}\\omega$ where $I(\\omega)$ represents the intensity of the thermal radiation as a function of angular frequency given as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    I(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4\\pi^2 c^2} \\frac{\\omega^3}{(e^{\\hbar \\omega/ k_B T} - 1)} \\qquad (1)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\hbar$, $k_B$, and $c$ are reduced Planck's constant ($h/(2\\pi)$), Boltzmann's constant, and the speed of light in a vacuum, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can then be shown that the total rate of black body energy radiation per unit area over all frequencies, $W$, is:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    W = \\frac{k_B^4 T^4}{4\\pi^2 c^2 \\hbar^3} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1}\\mathrm{d}x \\qquad (2)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we set out to numerically approximate the integral given in equation (2) using the Trapezoid rule, and estimate the accuracy of this method of numerical integration in this case. We will use Newman's suggested method in section 5.2.1 for 'practical estimation of errors' for Trapezoid rule to comment on the accuracy of the result. That is, the error for evaluating an integral for $N_2$ steps is given by $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{3}(I_2 - I_1)$ where $I_2$ is the value of the integral for $N_2$ steps and $I_1$ is the value of the integral for $N_1 = N_2/2$ steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform this numerical integration we will need to perform a change of variables to acquire a finite upper bound of integration. This transformation is given in Newman as $x = \\frac{z}{1-z}$. Simply substituting this change into equation (2) we see that the integrand in terms of $z$ becomes $\\frac{z^3}{(e^{z/(1-z)}-1)(1-z)^5}$ and it is simple to see that the lower bound is still $0$ but the upper bound becomes $1$ when integrating with respect to $z$ since $z \\rightarrow 1$ as $x \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is pseudocode highlighting the steps in this computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import required packages.\n",
    "2. Define the integrand as a function. NB: this should be the integrand resulting from the change of variables above. \n",
    "3. Define a general function for Trapezoid rule numerical integration with inputs: function to integrade, lower bound, upper bound, and number of steps. \n",
    "4. Define number of steps $N = 10$, a small quantity $\\delta = 10^-15$, and bounds of integration $a = \\delta$, $b = 1 - \\delta$. This is effectively as close to integrating from $0$ to $1$ as we can get without incurring a dividing by zero error. \n",
    "5. Evaluate the integral by calling Trapezoid rule function evaluated for the integrand function, $N$ steps, $a$ LB, $b$ UB. \n",
    "6. Evaluate integral using Newman's practical estimation of errors method in 5.2.1 (see above)."
